# Real-time-network-attack-detector-IoT-
Building upon the DDoS attack detection with ANN model project by expanding it to detect even more attacks with the use of only one model.
Some famous attacks that the model is able to detect are Port scanning, Mitm, Phishing, DDoS on ICMP,UDP,TCP,HTTP and etc.
Project also contains all the ML benchmarking that we performed and the scores we got.
More elaborate study on the project is provided in the Research Paper pdf
